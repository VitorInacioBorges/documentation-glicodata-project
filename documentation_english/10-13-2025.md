- While thinking about the project and the different ways to build it, I considered the applications and tools necessary for creating the site, which are more efficient on the Linux operating system (where PHP and PostgreSQL work natively). With that in mind, today's step was installing Linux on my machine to improve future web development. The installation was successfully done using a Linux installer on a 32GB USB drive. A separate partition was created from the main partition where Windows was installed, and the USB drive was booted from BIOS after restarting the machine. After following the steps correctly, the system was ready for personal and work use according to the initial plan.
