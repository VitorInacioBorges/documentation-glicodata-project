- The initial idea for building the application is to use PHP as the backend language, HTML and CSS for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database to store client data, following UEPG development standards (UEPG will be responsible for server maintenance). As the project grows, necessary implementations will be made and new features will be added. For now, the day's task was installing database management software — a set of tools for working with PostgreSQL such as pgAdmin, backLite, and others. The administrator login and database manipulation via terminal were also studied.
